                <p>This is a simple list of recipes to put to test what has been taught so
                    far on the topic of HTML and CSS. As you can see, this is the version of the
                    project with a lot of style and pesonality. IÂ´ve chosen to keep both in order to 
                    compare the progress made over time while studying the topic. Fell free to look
                    around and critically judge everything you see.

                    I do not own any of the recipes or images posted here. They have all been taken
                    from the source indicated at the end of each recipe and used to practice web 
                    development.
