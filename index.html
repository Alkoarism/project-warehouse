            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my project warehouse. Here is where I intend to expose
                to the world whatever I've been working with, some old stuff I've
                already moved on from and some unrelated but relevant projects.
                By itself this page is intended to be a hub through wich I and
                everyone else who comes can check my progress and inprovement as
                a developer over time. As such, threre are sections with various
                test pages for my personal use as well as project sections in
                exposition.
            </p>
            <p>With that said, please take your time and look around. You may find
                something that pick your interest.
            </p>

                    first step towards understanding the HTML structure of a 
                    multiple paged website. As such, no CSS was used in this version
                    of the page.

                    applied in order to grasp the basic working of a CSS file,

                    advanced CSS skills and concepts, such as creating a Page
                    from scratch using a simple image as reference and structures
                    like flexbox as well as more advanced HTML structuring
